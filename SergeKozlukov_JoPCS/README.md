#   README

I have used the packages `amsthm` for theorem environments
(environments and counters have custom names so no name conflicts)
and `amsmath` for matrices, `aligned` environment and
commands `\substack`, `\operatorname`, `\underbrace`,
`\lvert`, `\vline` and `\implies`.

I hope this doesn't cause any problems.
In the case it does, I provide the file `stripped.tex`
in which I have basically replaced all the external commands and environments
with ad-hoc hacks. Thus removed dependencies on any additional packages.
This stripped version doesn't look as well as the original one
so again I hope you will be OK with `amsthm` and `amsmath`.

Sincerely, Serge Kozlukov.
