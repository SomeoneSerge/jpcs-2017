#   README

I have used packages `amsthm` for theorem environments
(environments and counters have custom names so no name conflicts)
and `amsmath` for matrices, `aligned` environment and
commands `\substack`, `\operatorname`, `\underbrace`,
`\lvert`, `\vline` and `\implies`.

I hope this doesn't cause any problems.
But in case it does, I provide the file `stripped.tex`
    which basically replaces all these commands and environments
    with ad-hoc hacks thus removing dependency on any additional packages.
This stripped version doesn't look as well
    so again I hope you will be OK with `amsthm` and `amsmath`.

Sincerely, Serge Kozlukov.
